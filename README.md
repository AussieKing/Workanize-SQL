# IMPORTANT
## You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure that your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you. 

# STRUCTURE
## You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises.

## As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

## department

## id: INT PRIMARY KEY

## name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

## role

## id: INT PRIMARY KEY

## title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

## salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

## department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to
## 
## employee

## id: INT PRIMARY KEY
## 
## first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
## 
## last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
## 
## role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role
## 
## manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)
## 
## 


## You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier
